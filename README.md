## Temperature Conversion website
A temperature converter helps in the conversion of the measurement units of the temperature recorded in a particular unit. Temperature expresses the degree of heat or cold of a solid, liquid, or gas. Temperature is measured using a thermometer. While Kelvin (K) is the SI unit of temperature, people generally use Centigrade or Celsius (°C) and Fahrenheit (°F) to measure temperature.

For example, the lowest practical temperature on Earth is -273.15 degrees Celsius. Celsius is a measure of temperature. This recording can be represented in Kelvin as 0 K. We use temperature converter to find the different readings of a given temperature on different unit measuring scales.
A temperature converter helps convert the temperature between Fahrenheit and Celsius scale. Temperature is measured using a thermometer. While Kelvin (K) is the SI unit of temperature, people generally use Centigrade or Celsius (°C) and Fahrenheit (°F) to measure temperature. The temperature converter formula is used to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit.

## Units of Temperature
A temperature converter helps convert the temperature between Fahrenheit and Celsius scale. Temperature is measured using a thermometer. While Kelvin (K) is the SI unit of temperature, people generally use Centigrade or Celsius (°C) and Fahrenheit (°F) to measure temperature. The temperature converter formula is used to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit.
Different units can be used to record the temperature. The three different units used for measuring temperature are Celsius (°C) Fahrenheit (°F),  and Kelvin (K).  Kelvin is the SI unit of measuring temperature, whereas Fahrenheit and Celsius are commonly used scales.
